On the BTC/USDT futures exchange, there are orders in the glass:
* sell 0.2 @ 34000
* sell 0.5 @ 33000
* sell 0.2 @ 32000
* buy 0.15 @ 31000
* buy 0.45 @ 30000

A new market IOC order for the purchase of 0.6 volume arrives. 

What will happen and what will the glass look like as a result of execution?

> IOC-order - immediately or cancel.

Let's presume, that IOC-order has limit 33000.

So the result will be:
* sell 0.2 @ 34000
* sell 0.1 @ 33000
* buy 0.15 @ 31000
* buy 0.45 @ 30000

Because market IOC order will be fulfilled immediately.

I am new to this topic, so my advise will be about acting with caution. 

As a novice trader you must use stop-loss for every orders, if you don't want to loose all your money.

> Stop-loss is used when the price of your orders is getting down.
