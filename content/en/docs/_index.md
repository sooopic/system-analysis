Estimate time: **8 hours**.

Actually, it took me awhile for:
* Creating github page (I have never done it before, so it took some time)
* Installing a docsy theme for hugo (I wanted to practice with this theme )
* Finding a VPN for making a request for OKX (it is blocked in my current location)
* Reading about trading
