I have more than 10 years of professional IT experience. My career has 
been progressed from Support Engineer to Senior Software Engineer. I
have taken part and lead more than 10 succesfull projects from Fintech to 
Industrial Safety. Over the past two years I have expanded my professional 
experience both in business and system analysis.

work with highly professional and motivated team in an international
